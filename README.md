# biteman-online-food-order


### Notice: 
1. I found github online editor is broken... So I will style this read.me later.
2. Do not install any dependencies in this project for now unless you can make sure you will not install duplicated pakages and will not cause package conflicts. If you really want to start something for testing you can start a new project yourself!

### How to start
1. Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. go to the project directory, run ```npm install```
3. Hit ```localhost:3000```

### Reactjs
https://facebook.github.io/react/
And we will use react-router to keep the UI in sync with the URL
https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/v2.8.1/docs

### Nodejs - express, we use this framework for server side
https://expressjs.com/

### Mysql
We will use MySQL for now.
