## Technique stacks
We use REST API to design the web application, and use REACT in front-end, NODE for back-end and Mysql for database.


## How to start:
1. Go to the project directory, run ```npm install```
2. Start the project, run ```npm start```
3. Go to browser and visit ```localhost:3000```

Notice: Do not install any dependencies in this project for now unless you can make sure you will not install duplicated pakages and will not cause package conflicts. If you really want to start something for testing you can start a new project yourself!
