create a branch base on the master branch when you start a new feature.
git checkout -b your_branch_name
git checkout to_the_branch_you_want_to_go

when you finished your change, push your branch to the remote to have your teammates do a code review.
git push origin your_branch_name!
Do not push to master directly, please!

merge your branch to master using --squash
1. git checkout master
2. git pull origin master (get the latest code)
3. git merge --squash your_branch_name
4. commit && push your change to the remote master
